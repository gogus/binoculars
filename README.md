## Keeping the social distancing, support for vulnerable people

Based on WHO documents COVID-19 is often more severe in people who are older than 60 years or who have health conditions like lung or heart disease, diabetes, or conditions that affect their immune system. They should take more attention to the traffic in the places where they want to take for a walk or the shops which they want to use. Currently, there's no solution on the market which easily give us recommendations about the places which are safe to visit right now.
